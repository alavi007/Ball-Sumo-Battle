# Ball Sumo Battle Game (Unity 3D)

## Description

An arcade-style Ball Battle in which the objective is to knock enemies off of a floating island with the use of power ups.

## Brief Summary

- The enemy is given the ability to knock the player off of the cliff, chase the player around the island and spawn in random positions after each wave. 
- A boss enemy spawns after a random number of rounds have passed, and mini enemies continue to spawn alongside it until the boss is pushed off the cliff.
- Every time the enemies drop to zero, a new wave is spawned. The enemy and powerup count increase with each iteration.
- Powerups gives the player a temporary advantage. They will spawn in random positions on the island. These last for 7 seconds after pickup.
- Powerups include; “Super Strength” or “Smash Strength”, both that pushes away enemies!
- The camera evenly rotates around a focal point in the center of the island, provided with a horizontal input from the player. 

## Instructions on how to play the game
